## Overview
This app uses:
- Backend &rightarrow; NodeJS with TypeScript
- Database &rightarrow; MySQL
- FrontEnd &rightarrow; Angular 11, Bootstrap

About BootStrap, I have used the BootStrap theme lux from [BootSwatch](https://bootswatch.com/lux/).

## Running the project
First of all you have to run npm install in the server folder and client to install the node modules required. Once you have installed the node modules you can run the app with these commands:
1. Change your directory to server and run the command: npm run dev
2. Open another terminal and change to client directory, then you use the command: ng serve --open
