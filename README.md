# Games Crud
## Overview
This app uses:
- Backend &rightarrow; NodeJS with TypeScript
- Database &rightarrow; MySQL
- FrontEnd &rightarrow; Angular 11, Bootstrap

About BootStrap, I have used the BootStrap theme Lux from [BootSwatch](https://bootswatch.com/lux/).

## Running the project
First of all you have to run npm install in the server folder and client to install the node modules required. Once you have installed the node modules you can run the app with these commands:
1. Change to the server directory and run the command: **npm run dev*
2. Open another terminal and change to client directory, then you use the command: **ng serve --open**

With this last command the angular cli will open a tab in your browser where you can see the Games CRUD. Also you can access to the app going to the url http://localhost:4200/games.
